# Disease Model Analysis

This notebook focuses on the analysis and modeling of disease data to predict certain outcomes based on various inputs. Each cell within the notebook has a specific function, as described below.

## Sections

### 1. Applying EDA for the Data
- **Code Cell 1**: Imports required libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
- **Code Cell 2**: Reads training and test data from CSV files.
- **Code Cell 3**: Concatenates training and test data for unified processing.
- **Markdown Cell 4**: Heading for the EDA section.
- **Code Cell 5**: Displays information about dataframe columns, types, and non-null values.
- **Code Cell 6**: Provides statistical summaries of the dataframe.
- **Code Cell 7**: Counts null values across different columns to identify missing data.
- **Code Cell 8**: Converts categorical target variable into numerical format using label encoding.
- **Code Cell 9**: Counts total entries per disease after encoding.

### 2. Making the Model with Different Algorithms
- **Code Cell 10**: Visualizes correlation between features using a heatmap to assist in feature selection.

### 3. Visualizing the Output Model Performance
- **Further cells** would include additional code for model training, evaluation, and visualization not listed in detail here.
