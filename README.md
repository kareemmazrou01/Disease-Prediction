# Disease Model Analysis

This notebook focuses on the analysis and modeling of disease data to predict certain outcomes based on various inputs. Each cell within the notebook has a specific function, as described below.

## Data Features
The dataset includes the following features which are used to predict the disease status of individuals:
- **Cholesterol**: Level of cholesterol in the blood (mg/dL).
- **Hemoglobin**: Protein in red blood cells carrying oxygen.
- **Platelets**: Blood cells aiding in clotting.
- **White Blood Cells (WBC)**: Immune system cells fighting infections.
- **Red Blood Cells (RBC)**: Cells carrying oxygen.
- **Hematocrit**: Percentage of blood volume occupied by RBC.
- **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)**: Average volume of RBC.
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)**: Average amount of hemoglobin in RBC.
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)**: Average concentration of hemoglobin in RBC.
- **Insulin**: Hormone regulating blood sugar levels.
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: Measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)**: Pressure in arteries during heartbeats.
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)**: Pressure in arteries at rest between beats.
- **Triglycerides**: Type of fat found in blood (mg/dL).
- **HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin)**: Measure of average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months.
- **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol**: "Bad" cholesterol.
- **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol**: "Good" cholesterol.
- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**: Liver enzyme.
- **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)**: Enzyme found in the liver and heart.
- **Heart Rate**: Number of heartbeats per minute (bpm).
- **Creatinine**: Waste product produced by muscles and filtered by kidneys.
- **Troponin**: Protein released into the bloodstream during heart muscle damage.
- **C-reactive Protein (CRP)**: Marker of inflammation in the body.
- **Disease**: Binary indicator (1: Diseased, 0: Non-diseased).
